# Code Quality

## Code smells

> A code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system.

- Martin Fowler

## An example of a code smell

```{.python}
def calculate_fastest_time(time_list):
    fastest_time = time_list[0]
    for time in time_list:
        if time > fastest_time:
            fastest_time = time
    return fastest_time


def print_fastest_time(time_list):
    fastest_time = time_list[0]
    for time in time_list:
        if time > fastest_time:
            fastest_time = time

    print(f"This is the fastest time: {fastest_time} ðŸš€")
```
